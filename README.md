## Postman for Kafka
KafkaMan is developed using Angular and Ruby on Rails.

## Installation

- backend/README.MD for Ruby on Rails installation

## Future Works
- Change UI - Suggestions are appreciated!
- Fix bugs. Too lazy to fix'em now :v
- Enabling SSL to connect to kafka. 
- New filters for consumers.
- Tabs for consumers and producers.
- Maintaining history of produced messages.
