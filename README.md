# Kafka-Man
## Postman for Kafka
KafkaMan is developed using Angular and Ruby on Rails. Why Angular and RoR? Just wanted to learn.

## Motivation
Well, got tired of using console to produce and consume messages.

## Future Works
- Change UI - Suggestions are appreciated!
- Fix bugs. Too lazy to fix'em now :v
- Enabling SSL to connect to kafka. 
- New filters for consumers.
- Tabs for consumers and producers.
- Maintaining history of produced messages.

## Contribution
